# Gesture Based Computer Control

The Gesture-based Computer Control project enables users to control their computers using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The project allows for gesture-based control of system volume, brightness, and mouse actions such as click, drag,taking screenshots and cursor movements. This tool provides a hands-free way to interact with the computer, making it highly accessible and user-friendly.

## Features

- Volume Control: Adjust system volume using Right Hand fingre .
- Brightness Control: Control system brightness through Left hand fingre.
- Virtual Mouse: Using One hand Gesture Left Click, Right Click, Double Click,   Dragging, taking Screenshot
- Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detect and process hand gestures in real time via webcam input.
- Seamless Integration: Works without additional hardware, requiring only a webcam.


## Project Structure
- Drag_Click_screenshot_cursor.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for handling mouse controls (click, drag, cursor movement,screenshot) using hand gestures.
- Volume_Brightness.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for managing system volume and brightness adjustments using gestures.
- util.py: Python file containing utility functions for hand gesture detection and recognition.
## Tech Stack
**IDE**
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for developing and running the gesture control features.
**Backend**
- Python: Main language used to create gesture recognition and control logic.
- OpenCV: Library used for webcam input and frame processing.
- Mediapipe: Google's real-time hand gesture recognition library.
- PyAutoGUI: Used for controlling system functions (mouse, volume, brightness) programmatically.
- screen_brightness_control: installed it for controlling brightness
- pycaw: For Audio control
- Numpy: Used for numerical computations and array manipulation.

## Setup
**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6 or higher
